# The distance of a pair of integers a and b is defined as the absolute difference between a and b.
#
# Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the kth smallest
# distance among all the pairs nums[i] and nums[j] where 0 <= i < j < nums.length.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: nums = [1,3,1], k = 1
# Output: 0
# Explanation: Here are all the pairs:
# (1,3) -> 2
# (1,1) -> 0
# (3,1) -> 2
# Then the 1st smallest distance pair is (1,1), and its distance is 0.
# 二分法
