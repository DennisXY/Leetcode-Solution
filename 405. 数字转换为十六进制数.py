# Given an integer, write an algorithm to convert it to hexadecimal.
# For negative integer, twoâ€™s complement method is used.
#
# Note:
#
# All letters in hexadecimal (a-f) must be in lowercase.
# The hexadecimal string must not contain extra leading 0s.
# If the number is zero, it is represented by a single zero character '0';
# otherwise, the first character in the hexadecimal string will not be the zero character.
# The given number is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
# You must not use any method provided by the library which converts/formats the number to hex directly.
# Example 1:
#
# Input:
# 26
#
# Output:
# "1a"
# Example 2:
#
# Input:
# -1
#
# Output:
# "ffffffff"
