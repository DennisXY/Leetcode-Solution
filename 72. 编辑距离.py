# Given two strings word1 and word2, return the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2.
#
# You have the following three operations permitted on a word:
#
# Insert a character
# Delete a character
# Replace a character
# Â 
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
# Output: 3
# Explanation:
# horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
# rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
# rose -> ros (remove 'e')
# Example 2:
#
