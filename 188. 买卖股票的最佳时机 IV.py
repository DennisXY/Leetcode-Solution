# You are given an integer array prices where prices[i]is the price of a given stock
# on the ith day.
#
# Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most k transactions.
#
# Notice that you may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously
# (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: k = 2, prices = [2,4,1]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.
# Example 2:
#
# Input: k = 2, prices = [3,2,6,5,0,3]
# Output: 7
# Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4. Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
